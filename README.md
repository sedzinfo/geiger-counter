# geiger-counter
Small script for measuring dose rate in microsievert per hour with RadiationD-v1.1(CAJOE)

This script works with tinkerboard after installing and loading the relevant libraries from ASUS support for the GPIO

It will also work with raspberry pi if you load the relevant libraries

It uses prometheus so you will also need to setup a prometheus server localy https://prometheus.io/ to gather data

Finally you need to create a grafana account
