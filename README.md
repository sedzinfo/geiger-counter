Small script for measuring dose rate in microsievert per hour with RadiationD-v1.1(CAJOE)

This script works with tinkerboard after installing and loading the relevant libraries from ASUS support for the GPIO
It uses prometheus so you will also need to setup a prometheus server localy https://prometheus.io/
Finally you need to create a grafana account
